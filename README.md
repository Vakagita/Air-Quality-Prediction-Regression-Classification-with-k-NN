# Air-Quality-Prediction-Regression-Classification-with-k-NN
This project analyzes air pollution data collected by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in Taiwan, focusing on the relationship between PM2.5 levels and overall air quality. Using exploratory data analysis, linear regression, and statistical inference, the study evaluates how well PM2.5 predicts AQI (Air Quality Index). Additionally, a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier is implemented to categorize air quality as "Good" or "Bad" based on pollutant concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, and SO2. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, and the classifierâ€™s performance is evaluated for accuracy. The project also explores potential biases in the data and the limitations of regression and classification models in predicting real-world air quality trends.
